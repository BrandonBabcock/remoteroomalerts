# remoteroomalerts

The primary objective of the project was to use a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B to create a real-time room monitoring system that will send the user alerts via email. Some of the tools used include a passive infrared sensor, a five-megapixel camera, and robotic servos. In addition, the system can be used to monitor the room through a live video stream and control the cameras direction and orientation through a web-based panel.
